# ClassDef GitignoreChecker:
**GitignoreChecker**: The function of this Class is to check files and folders in a specified directory against the patterns defined in a .gitignore file. It returns a list of file paths that are not ignored and have the '.py' extension.

**attributes**: 
- directory (str): The directory to be checked.
- gitignore_path (str): The path to the .gitignore file.
- folder_patterns (list): A list of folder patterns extracted from the .gitignore file.
- file_patterns (list): A list of file patterns extracted from the .gitignore file.

**Code Description**: 
The `GitignoreChecker` class is responsible for loading and parsing the patterns defined in a .gitignore file, and then checking files and folders in a specified directory against these patterns. It provides methods to initialize the class, load and parse the .gitignore file, split the patterns into folder and file patterns, and check if a given path matches any of the patterns.

The class has an `__init__` method that takes in the `directory` and `gitignore_path` as arguments and initializes the class attributes. The `directory` is the directory to be checked, and the `gitignore_path` is the path to the .gitignore file. The method also calls the `_load_gitignore_patterns` method to load and parse the .gitignore file, and assigns the folder and file patterns to the `folder_patterns` and `file_patterns` attributes.

The `_load_gitignore_patterns` method is a private method that loads and parses the .gitignore file. It first tries to open the specified .gitignore file and read its content. If the file is not found, it falls back to the default .gitignore path. The method then calls the `_parse_gitignore` method to parse the content and returns the split patterns.

The `_parse_gitignore` method is a private method that parses the .gitignore content and returns the patterns as a list. It iterates over each line in the content, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and checks if the line is not empty and does not start with '#'. If the line meets these conditions, it appends it to the patterns list. The method returns the patterns list.

The `_split_gitignore_patterns` method is a private method that splits the .gitignore patterns into folder and file patterns. It iterates over each pattern and checks if it ends with '/'. If it does, it appends the pattern without the trailing '/' to the folder patterns list. Otherwise, it appends the pattern to the file patterns list. The method returns a tuple containing the folder and file patterns lists.

The `_is_ignored` method is a private method that checks if a given path matches any of the patterns. It takes in the `path`, `patterns`, and `is_dir` as arguments. It iterates over each pattern and checks if the path matches the pattern using the `fnmatch.fnmatch` function. If the path matches the pattern, it returns True. If the `is_dir` is True and the pattern ends with '/', it also checks if the path matches the pattern without the trailing '/'. If the path matches the pattern without the trailing '/', it returns True. If no match is found, it returns False.

The `check_files_and_folders` method checks all files and folders in the specified directory against the split gitignore patterns. It uses the `os.walk` function to iterate over all files and folders in the directory. It filters out ignored directories by modifying the `dirs` list using a list comprehension and the `_is_ignored` method. For each file, it constructs the file path and relative path, and checks if the file is not ignored, has the '.py' extension, and appends the relative path to the `not_ignored_files` list. Finally, it returns the `not_ignored_files` list.

**Note**: 
- The `directory` and `gitignore_path` should be valid paths.
- The `.gitignore` file should follow the standard format.
- The returned file paths are relative to the `directory`.

**Output Example**: 
If the directory contains the following files and folders:
- folder1/
- folder2/
- file1.py
- file2.py
- file3.txt

And the .gitignore file contains the following patterns:
- folder1/
- *.txt

The `check_files_and_folders` method will return:
- ['file1.py', 'file2.py']
## FunctionDef __init__(self, directory, gitignore_path):
**__init__**: The function of this Function is to initialize the GitignoreChecker with a specific directory and the path to a .gitignore file.

**parameters**: 
- directory (str): The directory to be checked.
- gitignore_path (str): The path to the .gitignore file.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor of the GitignoreChecker class. It takes two parameters: `directory` and `gitignore_path`. The `directory` parameter represents the directory to be checked for ignored files, and the `gitignore_path` parameter represents the path to the .gitignore file.

Inside the function, the `directory` and `gitignore_path` parameters are assigned to the `self.directory` and `self.gitignore_path` attributes of the GitignoreChecker object, respectively.

The function then calls the `_load_gitignore_patterns` method to load and parse the .gitignore file. The folder patterns and file patterns obtained from the .gitignore file are assigned to the `self.folder_patterns` and `self.file_patterns` attributes of the GitignoreChecker object, respectively.

**Note**: 
- The `directory` and `gitignore_path` parameters should be valid strings representing the directory path and the path to the .gitignore file, respectively.
- The function assumes that the .gitignore file exists at the specified `gitignore_path` or falls back to the default .gitignore path if the file is not found.

**Output Example**:
```
GitignoreChecker(directory='/path/to/directory', gitignore_path='/path/to/.gitignore')
```
Raw code:```
    def __init__(self, directory: str, gitignore_path: str):
        """
        Initialize the GitignoreChecker with a specific directory and the path to a .gitignore file.

        Args:
            directory (str): The directory to be checked.
            gitignore_path (str): The path to the .gitignore file.
        """
        self.directory = directory
        self.gitignore_path = gitignore_path
        self.folder_patterns, self.file_patterns = self._load_gitignore_patterns()

```
## FunctionDef _load_gitignore_patterns(self):
**_load_gitignore_patterns**: The function of this Function is to load and parse the .gitignore file, then split the patterns into folder and file patterns.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The function starts by attempting to open and read the .gitignore file specified by the `gitignore_path` attribute. If the file is found, its content is stored in the `gitignore_content` variable. If the file is not found, the function falls back to the default .gitignore path and reads its content instead.

Next, the function calls the `_parse_gitignore` method to parse the `gitignore_content` and obtain a list of patterns. These patterns are then passed to the `_split_gitignore_patterns` method, which splits them into two separate lists - one for folder patterns and one for file patterns.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the folder patterns and file patterns.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the `gitignore_path` attribute has been properly set before calling this method.
- If the specified .gitignore file is not found, the function falls back to the default .gitignore path.
- The function relies on the `_parse_gitignore` and `_split_gitignore_patterns` methods to perform the parsing and splitting of patterns.

**Output Example**:
```
(['folder_pattern1', 'folder_pattern2'], ['file_pattern1', 'file_pattern2'])
```
## FunctionDef _parse_gitignore(gitignore_content):
**_parse_gitignore**: The function of this Function is to parse the content of a .gitignore file and extract the patterns as a list.

**parameters**: 
- gitignore_content (str): The content of the .gitignore file.

**Code Description**:
The `_parse_gitignore` function takes the content of a .gitignore file as input and returns a list of patterns extracted from the content. 

The function starts by initializing an empty list called `patterns`. It then iterates over each line in the `gitignore_content` by splitting it using the `splitlines()` method. 

For each line, it removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters using the `strip()` method. If the line is not empty and does not start with a '#' character (indicating a comment), it appends the line to the `patterns` list.

Finally, the function returns the `patterns` list containing all the patterns extracted from the .gitignore content.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the `gitignore_content` parameter is a string representing the content of a .gitignore file.
- The function ignores empty lines and lines starting with '#' as they are considered comments in a .gitignore file.

**Output Example**:
If the `gitignore_content` is:
```
# Ignore compiled files
*.pyc
*.class

# Ignore log files
*.log
```
The function will return the following list:
```
['*.pyc', '*.class', '*.log']
```
## FunctionDef _split_gitignore_patterns(gitignore_patterns):
**_split_gitignore_patterns**: The function of this Function is to split the .gitignore patterns into folder patterns and file patterns.
**parameters**: 
- gitignore_patterns (list): A list of patterns from the .gitignore file.
**Code Description**: 
This function takes a list of patterns from the .gitignore file as input and splits them into two separate lists: one for folder patterns and one for file patterns. It iterates through each pattern in the input list and checks if it ends with a forward slash ("/"). If it does, it appends the pattern to the folder_patterns list after removing the trailing slash. If it doesn't end with a slash, it appends the pattern to the file_patterns list. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the folder_patterns and file_patterns lists.
**Note**: 
- The input list should contain patterns from the .gitignore file.
**Output Example**: 
If the input gitignore_patterns is ['folder/', 'file.txt', 'folder/subfolder/'], the function will return (['folder', 'folder/subfolder'], ['file.txt']).
## FunctionDef _is_ignored(path, patterns, is_dir):
**_is_ignored**: The function of this Function is to check if the given path matches any of the patterns.

**parameters**: 
- path (str): The path to check.
- patterns (list): A list of patterns to check against.
- is_dir (bool): True if the path is a directory, False otherwise.

**Code Description**: 
The `_is_ignored` function takes in a path, a list of patterns, and a boolean flag indicating whether the path is a directory or not. It iterates through each pattern in the list and checks if the path matches any of the patterns using the `fnmatch.fnmatch` function. If a match is found, the function returns True. Additionally, if the path is a directory and the pattern ends with a forward slash ("/"), it checks if the path matches the pattern without the trailing slash. If a match is found, the function also returns True. If no match is found after iterating through all the patterns, the function returns False.

**Note**: 
- The `fnmatch` module is used to perform pattern matching with the `fnmatch.fnmatch` function.
- The function assumes that the patterns provided are in the same format as those used in `.gitignore` files.

**Output Example**: 
- If the path is "/path/to/file.txt", the patterns are ["*.txt", "folder/"], and the is_dir flag is False, the function will return True.
- If the path is "/path/to/folder/", the patterns are ["*.txt", "folder/"], and the is_dir flag is True, the function will return True.
- If the path is "/path/to/file.txt", the patterns are ["*.md", "folder/"], and the is_dir flag is False, the function will return False.
## FunctionDef check_files_and_folders(self):
**check_files_and_folders**: The function of this Function is to check all files and folders in the given directory against the split gitignore patterns. It returns a list of files that are not ignored and have the '.py' extension. The returned file paths are relative to the self.directory.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The function starts by initializing an empty list called `not_ignored_files` to store the paths of files that are not ignored and have the '.py' extension.

Then, it uses the `os.walk()` function to iterate through all the files and folders in the given directory (`self.directory`). For each directory, it checks if it should be ignored by calling the `_is_ignored()` function with the directory name and the folder patterns. If the directory should not be ignored, it is kept in the `dirs` list.

Next, it iterates through all the files in each directory. For each file, it constructs the absolute file path by joining the root directory path and the file name. It also calculates the relative file path by calling the `os.path.relpath()` function with the absolute file path and the self.directory as arguments.

Then, it checks if the file should be ignored by calling the `_is_ignored()` function with the file name and the file patterns. It also checks if the file has the '.py' extension by using the `endswith()` method. If the file should not be ignored and has the '.py' extension, its relative path is added to the `not_ignored_files` list.

Finally, the function returns the `not_ignored_files` list.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the `self.directory` attribute has been properly set before calling this function.
- The `_is_ignored()` function is not defined in the given code snippet, so its behavior is not described here.

**Output Example**: 
If the given directory contains the following files and folders:
- folder1/
- folder2/
- file1.py
- file2.py
- file3.txt

And the gitignore patterns ignore the 'folder1' directory, the 'file2.py' file, and all files with the '.txt' extension, the function will return the following list:
- ['file1.py']
