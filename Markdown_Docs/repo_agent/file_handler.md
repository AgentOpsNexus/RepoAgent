# ClassDef FileHandler:
**FileHandler**: The FileHandler class is responsible for handling file-related operations within the repository. It provides methods for reading and writing file content, retrieving code information for a given object, getting the current and previous versions of a modified file, and generating the file structure of the repository.

**Attributes**:
- `repo_path`: The path to the repository.
- `file_path`: The relative path of the file.

**Code Description**:
- The `__init__` method initializes a FileHandler object with the repository path and file path.
- The `read_file` method reads the content of the file specified by the file path.
- The `get_obj_code_info` method retrieves the code information for a given object, such as its type, name, start and end line numbers, parent, and parameters.
- The `write_file` method writes content to a file specified by the file path.
- The `get_modified_file_versions` method gets the current and previous versions of the modified file.
- The `get_end_lineno` method retrieves the end line number of a given node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- The `add_parent_references` method adds a parent reference to each node in the AST.
- The `get_functions_and_classes` method retrieves all functions and classes in the code content, along with their parameters and hierarchical relationships.
- The `generate_file_structure` method generates the file structure for a given file path.
- The `generate_overall_structure` method generates the overall structure of the repository.
- The `convert_to_markdown_file` method converts the content of a file to markdown format.
- The `convert_all_to_markdown_files_from_json` method converts all files to markdown format based on the JSON data.

**Note**: The file path provided to the FileHandler methods is relative to the repository root directory.

**Output Example**:
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "read_file",
    "md_content": [],
    "code_start_line": 10,
    "code_end_line": 20,
    "parent": None,
    "params": []
}
## FunctionDef __init__(self, repo_path, file_path):
**__init__**: The function of this Function is to initialize the FileHandler object with the provided repo_path and file_path.

**parameters**: 
- repo_path (str): The path to the repository.
- file_path (str): The relative path of the file.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor of the FileHandler class. It takes in two parameters, `repo_path` and `file_path`, and initializes the corresponding attributes of the FileHandler object.

The `repo_path` parameter represents the path to the repository. It is assigned to the `self.repo_path` attribute.

The `file_path` parameter represents the relative path of the file. It is assigned to the `self.file_path` attribute.

**Note**: 
- The `repo_path` and `file_path` parameters should be valid paths.
- The `self.repo_path` attribute is used to store the path to the repository.
- The `self.file_path` attribute is used to store the relative path of the file.

**Output Example**: 
If the `repo_path` is "/path/to/repository" and the `file_path` is "folder/file.py", the `self.repo_path` attribute will be "/path/to/repository" and the `self.file_path` attribute will be "folder/file.py".
## FunctionDef read_file(self):
**read_file**: The function of this Function is to read the content of a file.

**Parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: This Function first constructs the absolute file path by joining the repository path and the file path. It then opens the file using the `open()` function with the mode set to read ('r') and the encoding set to 'utf-8'. The content of the file is read using the `read()` method and stored in the `content` variable. Finally, the content of the file is returned.

**Note**: This Function assumes that the `repo_path` and `file_path` attributes have been set correctly before calling this function. It is important to ensure that the file exists at the specified path and that the necessary permissions are granted to read the file.

**Output Example**: The content of the current changed file.
## FunctionDef get_obj_code_info(self, code_type, code_name, start_line, end_line, parent, params, file_path):
**get_obj_code_info**: The function of this Function is to retrieve code information for a given object.

**parameters**: 
- code_type (str): The type of the code.
- code_name (str): The name of the code.
- start_line (int): The starting line number of the code.
- end_line (int): The ending line number of the code.
- parent (str): The parent of the code.
- file_path (str, optional): The file path. Defaults to None.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_obj_code_info` function takes in several parameters including the type of the code, the name of the code, the starting and ending line numbers of the code, the parent of the code, and an optional file path. It returns a dictionary containing the code information.

The function first initializes an empty dictionary called `code_info`. It then assigns the provided parameters to the corresponding keys in the `code_info` dictionary. 

Next, the function opens the code file specified by the `file_path` parameter (or the default file path if `file_path` is None) using the `open` function. It reads all the lines of the code file and stores them in the `lines` variable. 

The function extracts the code content between the starting and ending line numbers using list slicing and joins the lines together into a single string. This code content is assigned to the `code_content` variable.

The function also determines the position of the code name in the first line of the code using the `find` method. If the code content contains the word "return", the `have_return` variable is set to True, otherwise it is set to False.

Finally, the function assigns the `have_return` variable, the code content, and the position of the code name to the corresponding keys in the `code_info` dictionary.

The `code_info` dictionary is then returned as the output of the function.

**Note**: 
- The `file_path` parameter is optional. If not provided, the function uses the default file path stored in the `self.file_path` attribute.
- The function assumes that the code file is encoded in UTF-8.

**Output Example**: 
{
  'type': 'function',
  'name': 'get_obj_code_info',
  'md_content': [],

}
## FunctionDef write_file(self, file_path, content):
**write_file**: The function of this Function is to write content to a file.

**parameters**: 
- file_path (str): The relative path of the file.
- content (str): The content to be written to the file.

**Code Description**: 
The `write_file` function takes in a `file_path` and `content` as parameters. It first checks if the `file_path` starts with a forward slash ("/"). If it does, it removes the leading slash. 

Then, it creates the absolute file path by joining the `repo_path` (which is the base path of the repository) with the `file_path`. It also creates any necessary directories in the file path using `os.makedirs` with the `exist_ok=True` parameter, which ensures that the directories are created if they don't already exist.

Finally, it opens the file at the absolute file path in write mode ('w') with the encoding set to 'utf-8'. It then writes the `content` to the file using the `file.write` method.

**Note**: 
- The `file_path` parameter should be a relative path, and if it starts with a forward slash ("/"), it will be removed before creating the absolute file path.
- The `content` parameter should be a string representing the content to be written to the file.
- The function assumes that the `repo_path` attribute is defined and represents the base path of the repository.
## FunctionDef get_modified_file_versions(self):
**get_modified_file_versions**: The function of this Function is to retrieve the current and previous versions of a modified file.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
This Function first initializes a git repository object using the `git.Repo` class, passing in the `repo_path` attribute of the current object as the repository path. 

Next, it reads the current version of the file by opening the file in the current working directory using the `open` function and reading its contents. The file path is obtained by joining the `repo_path` and `file_path` attributes of the current object.

Then, it retrieves the previous version of the file by getting the file version from the last commit in the repository. It does this by calling the `iter_commits` method on the repository object, passing in the `file_path` attribute of the current object and setting `max_count` to 1 to limit the number of commits to retrieve. The method returns a list of commits, and if the list is not empty, it retrieves the first commit and attempts to get the previous version of the file. If the file is not found in the commit's tree, it sets `previous_version` to `None`.

Finally, it returns a tuple containing the current version and the previous version of the file.

**Note**: 
- This Function assumes that the `git` module and the `os` module have been imported.
- The `repo_path` and `file_path` attributes of the current object should be set before calling this Function.
- The file should be encoded in UTF-8.

**Output Example**:
```
("Current file version", "Previous file version")
```
## FunctionDef get_end_lineno(self, node):
**get_end_lineno**: The function of this Function is to retrieve the end line number of a given node in the code.

**parameters**: 
- node: The node for which to find the end line number.

**Code Description**: 
This function takes a node as input and returns the end line number of that node. It first checks if the node has a 'lineno' attribute. If not, it means that the node does not have a line number, so it returns -1 to indicate this. 

If the node does have a line number, the function initializes the 'end_lineno' variable with the value of the node's line number. Then, it iterates over all the child nodes of the given node using the 'ast.iter_child_nodes()' function. For each child node, it recursively calls the 'get_end_lineno()' function to get its end line number. If the child node has a valid end line number (greater than -1), the 'end_lineno' variable is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the child node's end line number.

Finally, the function returns the 'end_lineno' value, which represents the end line number of the given node.

**Note**: 
- This function relies on the 'ast' module, which provides a way to parse Python source code and analyze its structure.
- The function assumes that the 'node' parameter is a valid node object that conforms to the structure defined by the 'ast' module.

**Output Example**: 
If the given node has an end line number of 10, the function will return 10. If the node does not have a line number, the function will return -1.
## FunctionDef add_parent_references(self, node, parent):
**add_parent_references**: The function of this Function is to add a parent reference to each node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

**parameters**: 
- node: The current node in the AST.
- parent: The parent node of the current node. It is an optional parameter and defaults to None.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_parent_references` function is a recursive function that traverses the AST and adds a parent reference to each node. It takes the current node as an argument and iterates over its child nodes using the `ast.iter_child_nodes` function. For each child node, it sets the parent reference to the current node by assigning `node` to `child.parent`. Then, it recursively calls the `add_parent_references` function with the child node as the new current node and the current node as the parent.

**Note**: 
- This function is useful when working with ASTs and analyzing the relationships between nodes. By adding parent references, it becomes easier to navigate and manipulate the AST.
- It is important to note that the `add_parent_references` function modifies the AST in-place and does not return anything.
## FunctionDef get_functions_and_classes(self, code_content):
**get_functions_and_classes**: The function of this Function is to retrieve all functions, classes, their parameters (if any), and their hierarchical relationships from the given code content.

**parameters**: 
- code_content: The code content of the whole file to be parsed.

**Code Description**: 
This function takes the code content as input and parses it using the `ast` module. It then traverses the abstract syntax tree (AST) and identifies all function definitions (`FunctionDef`), class definitions (`ClassDef`), and async function definitions (`AsyncFunctionDef`). For each identified node, it extracts the name, starting line number, ending line number, parent node name (if applicable), and parameters (if any). The extracted information is stored in a list of tuples.

**Note**: 
- The `ast` module is used to parse the code content and extract the required information.
- The `add_parent_references` method is called internally to add parent references to the AST nodes.
- The `get_end_lineno` method is used to determine the ending line number of a node.
- The returned list of tuples contains the following information for each function or class: type of the node, name of the node, starting line number, ending line number, name of the parent node (if applicable), and a list of parameters.

**Output Example**: 
[('FunctionDef', 'AI_give_params', 86, 95, None, ['param1', 'param2']), ('ClassDef', 'PipelineEngine', 97, 104, None, []), ('FunctionDef', 'get_all_pys', 99, 104, 'PipelineEngine', ['param1'])]
## FunctionDef generate_file_structure(self, file_path):
**generate_file_structure**: The function of this Function is to generate the file structure for a given file path.

**parameters**: 
- file_path (str): The relative path of the file.

**Code Description**:
The `generate_file_structure` function takes a `file_path` as input and generates the file structure for the given file. It first opens the file using the `open` function and reads its content. Then, it calls the `get_functions_and_classes` method to extract the functions and classes from the file content. 

For each structure (function or class) found in the file, the function creates a dictionary entry in the `file_objects` dictionary. The dictionary key is the name of the structure, and the value is the code information obtained from the `get_obj_code_info` method. The code information includes the structure type (function or class), name, start line, end line, parent, and parameters.

Finally, the function returns the `file_objects` dictionary containing the file path and the generated file structure.

**Note**: 
- The `file_path` parameter should be a relative path to the file.
- The `get_functions_and_classes` and `get_obj_code_info` methods are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.

**Output Example**:
{
    "function_name": {
        "type": "function",
        "start_line": 10,
        ··· ···
        "end_line": 20,
        "parent": "class_name"
    },
    "class_name": {
        "type": "class",
        "start_line": 5,
        ··· ···
        "end_line": 25,
        "parent": None
    }
}
## FunctionDef generate_overall_structure(self):
**generate_overall_structure**: The function of this Function is to generate the overall structure of the repository.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
This function starts by initializing an empty dictionary called `repo_structure`. It then creates an instance of the `GitignoreChecker` class, passing the repository path and the path to the `.gitignore` file as arguments. The `GitignoreChecker` class is responsible for checking which files and folders are not ignored by the `.gitignore` file.

Next, the function iterates over the files and folders that are not ignored by the `.gitignore` file. For each file or folder, it calls the `generate_file_structure` method to generate its structure. If an error occurs during the generation of the file structure, an error message is printed and the loop continues to the next file or folder.

Finally, the function returns the `repo_structure` dictionary, which represents the overall structure of the repository.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the `generate_file_structure` method is defined and implemented elsewhere in the codebase.
- The `GitignoreChecker` class and the `generate_file_structure` method are not defined in the given code snippet. They are referenced in the code and should be implemented separately.

**Output Example**: 
{
    "file1.txt": {
        "subfile1.txt": {},
        "subfile2.txt": {}
    },
    "file2.txt": {},
    "folder1": {
        "subfile3.txt": {},
        "subfolder1": {
            "subfile4.txt": {}
        }
    }
}
## FunctionDef convert_to_markdown_file(self, file_path):
**convert_to_markdown_file**: The function of this Function is to convert the content of a file to markdown format.

**parameters**: 
- file_path (str, optional): The relative path of the file to be converted. If not provided, the default file path, which is None, will be used.

**Code Description**: 
The function first opens the project_hierarchy.json file and reads its content using the 'utf-8' encoding. It then loads the JSON data into the json_data variable.

If the file_path parameter is not provided, the function assigns the value of self.file_path to file_path.

The function searches for the file object in the json_data dictionary that matches the file_path. If no file object is found, it raises a ValueError with a message indicating that no file object was found for the specified file path in project_hierarchy.json.

The function initializes an empty string variable called markdown. It also creates an empty dictionary called parent_dict to store the parent-child relationship between objects.

The function sorts the values of the file_dict dictionary based on the 'code_start_line' key in ascending order and assigns the sorted objects to the objects variable.

The function then iterates over each object in the objects list. For each object, it checks if the 'parent' key is not None. If it is not None, it adds the parent-child relationship to the parent_dict dictionary.

The function initializes a variable called current_parent to None. It then iterates over each object in the objects list again. For each object, it calculates the level of the object by counting the number of times it needs to traverse the parent_dict dictionary. If the level is equal to 1 and current_parent is not None, it adds a horizontal rule to the markdown string.

The function updates the current_parent variable with the name of the current object. If the object is a function definition and has parameters, it adds the parameters to the markdown string.

The function appends the last element of the 'md_content' list of the object to the markdown string. If the 'md_content' list is empty, it appends an empty string.

Finally, the function adds a horizontal rule to the markdown string.

**Note**: 
- The function requires the project_hierarchy.json file to be present and properly formatted.
- If the file_path parameter is not provided, the function uses the default file path stored in self.file_path.
- The function assumes that the file object for the specified file path exists in the project_hierarchy.json file. If it does not exist, a ValueError is raised.
## FunctionDef convert_all_to_markdown_files_from_json(self):
**convert_all_to_markdown_files_from_json**: The function of this Function is to convert all files to markdown format based on the JSON data.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: This function reads the project hierarchy from a JSON file and checks if the "Markdown_docs" folder exists. If the folder does not exist, it creates the folder. Then, it iterates through each file in the JSON data. For each file, it converts the file to markdown format and writes it to the "Markdown_docs" folder.

First, the function opens the JSON file and loads the data into the `json_data` variable. 

Next, it checks if the "Markdown_docs" folder exists in the root directory of the repository. If the folder does not exist, it creates the folder using the `os.mkdir()` function.

Then, the function iterates through each file in the `json_data` dictionary. For each file, it creates the path for the markdown file by replacing the file extension with ".md". It then calls the `convert_to_markdown_file()` function to convert the file to markdown format and assigns the result to the `markdown` variable.

After that, the function checks if the directory for the markdown file exists. If the directory does not exist, it creates the directory using the `os.makedirs()` function.

Finally, the function writes the markdown content to the markdown file using the `open()` function with the "w" mode and the `write()` method.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the project hierarchy is stored in a JSON file and the path to the file is specified in the `project_hierarchy` attribute of the `FileHandler` object.
- The function also assumes that the repository path is specified in the `repo_path` attribute of the `FileHandler` object.
- The function uses the `CONFIG` dictionary to get the name of the "Markdown_docs" folder.
- The function uses the `convert_to_markdown_file()` function to convert each file to markdown format. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code snippet.
