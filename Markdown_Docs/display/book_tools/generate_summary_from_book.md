# FunctionDef create_readme_if_not_exist(dire):
**create_readme_if_not_exist**: The function of this Function is to create a README.md file in a given directory if it doesn't already exist.

**parameters**: 
- dire: The directory in which the README.md file should be created.

**Code Description**: 
The `create_readme_if_not_exist` function takes in a directory path `dire` as a parameter. It checks if a README.md file already exists in the directory. If it doesn't, the function creates a new README.md file and writes the directory name as a header in the file.

The function first constructs the path to the README.md file by joining the `dire` directory path with the filename 'README.md'. It then checks if the file already exists using the `os.path.exists` function.

If the README.md file doesn't exist, the function opens the file in write mode using the `open` function with the 'w' mode. It then retrieves the base name of the directory using the `os.path.basename` function and writes it as a header in the README.md file using the `write` method of the file object. The header is formatted as a markdown heading using the `format` method of the string.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the `os` module has been imported before calling this function.
- The function assumes that the `dire` parameter is a valid directory path.

Raw code:```
def create_readme_if_not_exist(dire):
    readme_path = os.path.join(dire, 'README.md')

    if not os.path.exists(readme_path):
        with open(readme_path, 'w') as readme_file:
            dirname = os.path.basename(dire)
            readme_file.write('# {}\n'.format(dirname))
```

# FunctionDef output_markdown(dire, base_dir, output_file, iter_depth):
**output_markdown**: The function of this Function is to generate a markdown file that represents the directory structure of a given directory.

**parameters**: 
- dire: The directory to be processed.
- base_dir: The base directory of the project.
- output_file: The output file object to write the markdown content.
- iter_depth: The current depth of iteration.

**Code Description**: 
The `output_markdown` function takes in a directory `dire`, the base directory `base_dir`, an output file object `output_file`, and an iteration depth `iter_depth`. It is used to generate a markdown file that represents the directory structure of the given directory.

The function first iterates over the files and directories in the `dire` directory. For each file or directory, it performs the following steps:

1. If the item is a directory, it calls the `create_readme_if_not_exist` function to create a README.md file if it doesn't already exist in the directory.

2. It then checks if the README.md file exists in the directory. If it does, it creates a markdown link to it in the output file. The relative path to the README.md file is calculated using `os.path.relpath`.

3. The function recursively calls itself for nested directories, passing the nested directory path, base directory, output file, and incremented iteration depth.

4. If the item is a file and it is a markdown file, it checks if it should be included in the output. Files named 'SUMMARY.md' and 'README.md' are excluded unless the iteration depth is greater than 0 and the file is not 'README.md'. If the file should be included, it creates a markdown link to it in the output file.

**Note**: 
- The `create_readme_if_not_exist` function is called to create a README.md file in each directory if it doesn't already exist.

# FunctionDef markdown_file_in_dir(dire):
**markdown_file_in_dir**: The function of this Function is to check if there is a markdown file in a given directory.

**parameters**: 
- dire: A string representing the directory path to be checked.

**Code Description**: 
This function takes a directory path as input and checks if there is a markdown file (.md or .markdown) present in that directory or any of its subdirectories. It uses the `os.walk()` function to traverse through the directory tree and `re.search()` function to match the file extensions.

The function starts by calling `os.walk(dire)`, which returns a generator that yields a tuple for each directory in the directory tree rooted at `dire`. Each tuple contains three elements: the path to the directory, a list of subdirectories, and a list of filenames in that directory.

The function then iterates over each directory and its corresponding filenames. For each filename, it uses `re.search()` to check if the file extension matches either ".md" or ".markdown". If a match is found, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a markdown file exists in the directory.

If no markdown file is found after checking all directories and filenames, the function returns `False`.

**Note**: 
- This function only checks for markdown files with the extensions ".md" or ".markdown". It does not consider other file formats.
- The function does not perform any error handling for invalid directory paths or other exceptions that may occur during the file search process.

**Output Example**: 
If the function is called with the directory path "display/book_tools", and there is a markdown file named "example.md" in the "display/book_tools" directory, the function will return `True`.
***
# FunctionDef is_markdown_file(filename):
**is_markdown_file**: The function of this Function is to determine whether a given filename is a markdown file.

**parameters**: 
- filename: A string representing the name of the file.

**Code Description**: 
The function first uses the `re.search()` function to search for a match of the pattern '.md$|.markdown$' in the given filename. If there is no match, it means that the file is not a markdown file, so the function returns False.

If there is a match, the function checks the length of the matched group. If the length is equal to the length of '.md', it means that the file extension is '.md'. In this case, the function returns the filename without the last 3 characters (which represent the '.md' extension).

If the length is equal to the length of '.markdown', it means that the file extension is '.markdown'. In this case, the function returns the filename without the last 9 characters (which represent the '.markdown' extension).

**Note**: 
- This function relies on the `re` module, so make sure to import it before using this function.
- The function assumes that the filename provided is a valid string.

**Output Example**: 
- If the filename is 'example.md', the function will return 'example'.
- If the filename is 'README.markdown', the function will return 'README'.

# FunctionDef main:
**main**: The function of this Function is to generate a summary file for a book.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `main` function is the entry point for generating a summary file for a book. It first retrieves the name of the book from the command line arguments. Then, it creates a directory path for the book by joining the `./books` directory with the book name and the `src` subdirectory. 

Next, it checks if the directory path exists. If it doesn't, it creates the directory using the `os.makedirs` function. 

After ensuring that the directory exists, the function proceeds to create the summary file. It opens a file named `SUMMARY.md` inside the book directory in write mode. It writes the header `# Summary` to the file.

Then, it calls the `output_markdown` function, passing the directory path, the same directory path, and the output file as arguments. This function is responsible for generating the content of the summary file.

Finally, the function prints a message indicating that the GitBook auto summary is finished and returns 0.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the book name is provided as a command line argument.
- The `output_markdown` function is expected to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**: 
```
# Summary

[Generated summary content]
```
