# FunctionDef main:
**main**: The function of this Function is to copy the contents of a specified directory to a destination directory, and create a README.md file in the destination directory if it does not exist.

**parameters**: This Function does not have any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
- The function first retrieves the command line arguments passed to the script, which are the markdown_docs_folder, book_name, and repo_path.
- It then creates the destination directory path by joining the './books', book_name, and 'src' directories.
- The docs_dir variable is set to the path of the markdown_docs_folder within the repo_path.
- The function checks if the destination directory does not exist, and if so, it creates the directory using os.makedirs() and prints a message indicating the creation of the directory.
- It then iterates over the items in the docs_dir directory using os.listdir().
- For each item, it constructs the source path by joining the docs_dir and the item, and the destination path by joining the dst_dir and the item.
- If the item is a directory, it uses shutil.copytree() to recursively copy the directory and its contents to the destination directory, and prints a message indicating the copy operation.
- If the item is a file, it uses shutil.copy2() to copy the file to the destination directory, and prints a message indicating the copy operation.
- The function then defines a nested function called create_book_readme_if_not_exist() that takes a directory path as an argument.
- Inside this nested function, it constructs the path to the README.md file within the specified directory.
- If the README.md file does not exist, it creates the file using open() in write mode, and writes the book_name as the content of the file.
- Finally, the main function calls the create_book_readme_if_not_exist() function with the dst_dir as the argument to create the README.md file in the destination directory.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the command line arguments are passed correctly and in the expected order.
- The function uses the shutil module from the standard library to perform the file and directory copying operations.
- If the destination directory already exists, the function will not overwrite any existing files or directories.
## FunctionDef create_book_readme_if_not_exist(dire):
**create_book_readme_if_not_exist**: The function of this Function is to create a README.md file if it does not already exist in the specified directory.

**parameters**: 
- dire: The directory path where the README.md file should be created.

**Code Description**:
The function first constructs the path to the README.md file by joining the specified directory path (`dire`) with the filename 'README.md'. 

Next, it checks if the README.md file already exists in the specified directory by using the `os.path.exists()` function. If the file does not exist, it proceeds to create it.

To create the file, it opens the README.md file in write mode using the `open()` function with the 'w' flag. It then writes the content to the file using the `write()` method of the file object. In this case, it writes a single line containing the book name surrounded by '#' symbols.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the `os` module has been imported and is available.
- The `book_name` variable used in the code snippet is not defined in the given code. It should be replaced with the actual book name before using this function.
