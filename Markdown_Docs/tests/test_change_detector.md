# ClassDef TestChangeDetector:
**TestChangeDetector**: The function of this Class is to test the functionality of the ChangeDetector class.

**attributes**: This Class does not have any attributes.

**Code Description**:
The TestChangeDetector Class is a subclass of the unittest.TestCase Class, which is used for writing and running tests. It contains several test methods that test different functionalities of the ChangeDetector class.

The setUpClass() method is a class method that is called once before any tests are run. In this method, the test repository path is defined and created if it does not exist. The Git repository is initialized, and the user information is configured. Some test files are created and added to the repository. Finally, the files are committed.

The test_get_staged_pys() method is a test method that tests the get_staged_pys() method of the ChangeDetector class. It creates a new Python file, adds it to the repository, and then uses the ChangeDetector class to get the staged Python files. It asserts that the newly created file is present in the staged files list.

The test_get_unstaged_mds() method is a test method that tests the get_unstaged_mds() method of the ChangeDetector class. It modifies a Markdown file without staging it and then uses the ChangeDetector class to get the unstaged Markdown files. It asserts that the modified file is present in the unstaged files list.

The test_add_unstaged_mds() method is a test method that tests the add_unstaged_mds() method of the ChangeDetector class. It ensures that there is at least one unstaged Markdown file by calling the test_get_unstaged_mds() method. Then, it uses the ChangeDetector class to add the unstaged files. It checks if there are any remaining unstaged Markdown files after the add operation.

The tearDownClass() method is a class method that is called once after all the tests have been run. It cleans up the test repository by closing the Git repository and removing the test repository directory.

**Note**: 
- The TestChangeDetector Class is used to test the functionality of the ChangeDetector class.
- The setUpClass() method is used to set up the test environment before running the tests.
- The test methods test specific functionalities of the ChangeDetector class.
- The tearDownClass() method is used to clean up the test environment after running the tests.
## FunctionDef setUpClass(cls):
**setUpClass**: The function of this Function is to set up the necessary environment for the test class. It creates a test repository, initializes a Git repository, configures the Git user information, creates some test files, and simulates Git operations to add and commit the files.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The code begins by defining the test repository path using the `os.path.join()` function, which joins the directory path of the current file (`__file__`) with the 'test_repo' folder name. This ensures that the test repository is created in the same directory as the test file.

Next, the code checks if the test repository folder does not exist using the `os.path.exists()` function. If the folder does not exist, it creates the folder using the `os.makedirs()` function.

The code then initializes a Git repository using the `Repo.init()` method, passing the test repository path as an argument. This creates a new Git repository in the test repository folder.

Next, the code configures the Git user information using the `repo.git.config()` method. It sets the email to 'ci@example.com' and the name to 'CI User'. This ensures that the Git commits made during the test have the correct user information.

The code then creates two test files in the test repository folder using the `open()` function. It opens the files in write mode and writes some content to them. The first file is named 'test_file.py' and contains the line `print("Hello, Python")`. The second file is named 'test_file.md' and contains the line `# Hello, Markdown`.

After creating the test files, the code simulates Git operations to add and commit the files. It uses the `repo.git.add()` method with the `A=True` argument to add all files in the repository. This stages the files for commit. Then, it uses the `repo.git.commit()` method with the `-m` argument to commit the changes with the message 'Initial commit'.

**Note**: 
- This function is used to set up the necessary environment for the test class.
- It assumes that the test repository has already been set up and initialized with Git.
- The test repository path is obtained using the `test_repo_path` attribute, which is set in the `setUpClass` method of the test class.
## FunctionDef test_get_staged_pys(self):
**test_get_staged_pys**: The function of this Function is to test the functionality of the `get_staged_pys` method in the `ChangeDetector` class.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: This function first creates a new Python file called "new_test_file.py" and writes the content "print("New Python File")" into it. The file is then added to the staging area using the `git.add` method.

Next, an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class is created, passing the path of the test repository as an argument. The `get_staged_pys` method is then called on the `change_detector` object to retrieve a list of staged Python files.

The function asserts that the newly created file "new_test_file.py" is present in the list of staged files by checking if its basename exists in the list.

Finally, the function prints the list of staged Python files.

**Note**: 
- This function is used to test the functionality of the `get_staged_pys` method in the `ChangeDetector` class.
- It assumes that the test repository has already been set up and initialized.
- The `ChangeDetector` class and the `os` module need to be imported for this function to work properly.
## FunctionDef test_get_unstaged_mds(self):
**test_get_unstaged_mds**: The function of this Function is to test the functionality of the `get_unstaged_mds` method in the `ChangeDetector` class.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The code begins by creating a new Markdown file named `test_file.md` in the test repository directory. Some additional content is then appended to the file. 

Next, an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class is created, passing the test repository path as an argument. 

The `get_to_be_staged_files` method is called on the `change_detector` object to retrieve a list of unstaged files in the repository.

The code then asserts that the modified file (`test_file.md`) is present in the list of unstaged files.

Finally, a message is printed to the console, displaying the list of unstaged Markdown files.

**Note**: 
- This function is used to test the functionality of the `get_unstaged_mds` method in the `ChangeDetector` class.
- It assumes that the test repository has already been set up and initialized with Git.
- The test repository path is obtained using the `test_repo_path` attribute, which is set in the `setUpClass` method of the `TestChangeDetector` class.
## FunctionDef test_add_unstaged_mds(self):
**test_add_unstaged_mds**: The function of this Function is to test the functionality of adding unstaged Markdown files.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: This Function first ensures that there is at least one unstaged Markdown file by calling the `test_get_unstaged_mds()` function. 

Then, it creates an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class, passing the test repository path as a parameter. This `ChangeDetector` object is used to perform the operation of adding unstaged files.

Next, it calls the `add_unstaged_files()` method of the `ChangeDetector` object to add the unstaged Markdown files.

After that, it retrieves the list of files that are still unstaged by calling the `get_to_be_staged_files()` method of the `ChangeDetector` object.

Finally, it asserts that the length of the `unstaged_files_after_add` list is equal to 0, indicating that all the unstaged Markdown files have been successfully staged. It also prints the number of remaining unstaged Markdown files after the add operation.

**Note**: It is important to note that this test function assumes the existence of at least one unstaged Markdown file before the add operation is performed.
## FunctionDef tearDownClass(cls):
**tearDownClass**: The function of this Function is to perform cleanup operations after all the test cases in the test class have been executed.

**parameters**: The parameter of this Function is `cls`, which represents the class itself.

**Code Description**: 
The `tearDownClass` function is responsible for cleaning up the test repository and closing the repository connection. 

In the code, the function first closes the repository connection by calling `cls.repo.close()`. This ensures that the repository is properly closed and any resources associated with it are released.

Next, the function removes the test repository directory by executing the command `os.system('rm -rf ' + cls.test_repo_path)`. This command uses the `os.system` function to execute the shell command `rm -rf` followed by the path of the test repository directory (`cls.test_repo_path`). The `rm -rf` command is used to forcefully remove a directory and its contents. By executing this command, the function ensures that the test repository directory is completely removed.

**Note**: 
- It is important to call `tearDownClass` after all the test cases in the test class have been executed to perform the necessary cleanup operations.
- The `tearDownClass` function assumes that the test repository has been initialized and the path to the test repository directory is stored in `cls.test_repo_path`.
- The `tearDownClass` function uses the `os.system` function to execute a shell command. This can be a potential security risk if the command is constructed using user input. It is important to ensure that the command is constructed safely to prevent any unintended consequences.
