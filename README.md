# 🤗 Introduction

AI_doc is an Open-Source project driven by Large Language Models(LLMs) that aims to provide an intelligent way to document projects. 
It is designed to be a handy tool for developers who need to organize their code and cooperate with teammates.

# 👾 Background
In the realm of computer programming, the significance of comprehensive project documentation, including detailed explanations for each Python file, cannot be overstated. Such documentation serves as the cornerstone for understanding, maintaining, and enhancing the codebase. It provides essential context and rationale for the code, making it easier for current and future developers to comprehend the purpose, functionality, and structure of the software. It not only facilitates current and future developers in grasping the project's purpose and structure but also ensures that the project remains accessible and modifiable over time, significantly easing the learning curve for new team members.

Traditionally, creating and maintaining software documentation demanded significant human effort and expertise, a challenge for small teams without dedicated personnel. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT has transformed this, enabling AI to handle much of the documentation process. This shift allows human developers to focus on verification and fine-tuning, greatly reducing the manual burden of documentation.

**🏆 Our goal is to create a super-intelligent doc assistant that saves time and formulate documents for human.**

# 📚 Features
